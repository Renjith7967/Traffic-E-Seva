             New Delhi: Indian Police Service (IPS) officer SN Shrivastava has been given additional charge as the chief of Delhi Police from March 1 until further orders, days after he was made Special Commissioner (Law and Order) by the Home Ministry after bringing him from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to end the violence over the controversial citizenship law in Delhi. Mr Shrivastava will replace Amulya Patnaik, who retires tomorrow.
"My primary job will be to ensure that there is a feeling of security and people should also feel police are there for them," Mr Shrivastava said, news agency Press Trust of India reported.Mr Shrivastava is a 1985-batch officer of the Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory or AGMUT cadre. Mr Patnaik's tenure, which was extended for a month, ends tomorrow, as the centre works to restore peace in areas hit by violence in northeast Delhi that killed 42 and left hundreds injured.

Mr Shrivastava's appointment fills a void in the Delhi Police that is seen as grappling with a leadership crisis, sources have told NDTV. His appointed will be formally issued by the Lieutenant Governor.

"People did not believe intentions of Delhi Police during the violence. Even the image of Commissioner of Delhi Police was not very good for whatever reasons. But soon Delhi will have a new Police Commissioner," National Security Advisor Ajit Doval had told NDTV.

The Central Reserve Police Force has relieved Mr Shrivastava to join the new post.
