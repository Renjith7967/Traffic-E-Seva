                   Kanpur: Uttar Pradesh gangster Vikas Dubey killed by police in an encounter faced a total of 61 criminal cases, including eight of murder involving the killing of at least 15 people.
The last murder case registered in UP's Chaubeypur police station in Kanpur district following the ambush of a police team by his henchmen alone accounts for the killing of eight policemen, besides the seven other cases of murder registered against him between 1992 and 2017, reveals a police history sheet on Vikas Dubey's offences.

In his three-decade as a criminal, starting in 1990, Vikas Dubey faced nine cases of attempts to murder besides two under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances or NDPS Act, seven under the Gangsters Act, six under the Goonda Act, three under the Arms Act, besides a slew of cases for various other penal offences.

Nearly 80 per cent of the 61 FIRs registered against him were filed during the first half of his criminal career which came to a gory end on Friday.

The first case against Vikas Dubey, a native of Bikru village under Chaubeypur police station in Kanpur, was registered against him in 1990 for causing "grievous hurt" and "provoking breach of peace" by intentional insult, reveal official documents accessed by news agency Press Trust of India.

Vikas Dubey was around 30 years old when he was charged under the National Security Act in 2001. The FIR was lodged at the Shivli police station in Kanpur.
